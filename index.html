                <h3>A full stack Web Developer:</h3>
                <p class="justify">I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with
                    HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless
                    information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.

            <h3>Become a full stck web developer:</h3>
            <p class="justify">I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using, and my Instapaper “Starred” list will give you a glimpse into the reading material I find interesting enough to share.</p>
